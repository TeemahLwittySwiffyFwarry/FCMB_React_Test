ðŸ“˜ FCMB Career Portal (React Project)

This project is a responsive React.js web application simulating a simple Career Portal interface for FCMB.
It demonstrates:

API data fetching (using reqres.in)

Component reusability

Responsive layout design with Tailwind CSS

Clean code structure with modularized components

ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Registration Page

Users can enter their name and job.

Data is submitted to a mock API (https://reqres.in/api/users) using fetch().

Displays success or error messages.

Automatically redirects to the User List page on success.

Beautiful and mobile-responsive layout with a left-side background image and right-side form.

âœ… User List (Paginated List Page)

Fetches user data from Reqres API (https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2).

Displays user cards with avatar, email, and name.

Clicking a user shows their details and a Proceed button.

Paginated with Next and Previous buttons.

Sidebar navigation included via a reusable Sidebar component.

âœ… Sidebar Component

Includes FCMB logo and navigation menu.

Responsive on small screens.

Organized with adequate spacing between menu items.

âœ… Bottom Navigation Component

Shows app features like Transfers, Airtime Top-up, QR Scanner, and Location.

Extracted into a separate component (BottomNav.js) for reusability.

Automatically behaves like a fixed bottom bar on mobile and inline footer on desktop.
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
